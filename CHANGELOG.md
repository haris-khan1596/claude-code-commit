# Changelog

All notable changes to the "claude-code-commits" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Built-in default Conventional Commits prompt — works out of the box without any template file
- Optional custom prompt override via `.vscode/commit-rules.md` in your workspace
- Configurable commit rules path setting (`sparkleCommit.commitRulesPath`)
- Commit style setting (`sparkleCommit.commitStyle`) — choose between `conventional`, `prefix`, or `simple` message formats
- Diff source setting (`sparkleCommit.diffSource`) — use `staged`, `all`, or `auto` to control which changes are analyzed
- Marketplace keywords and proper categories for better discoverability

### Changed

- Prompt template path moved from `.claude/commands/git.commit.md` to `.vscode/commit-rules.md`
- Missing template no longer shows an error — falls back to the built-in default silently
- Removed redundant `activationEvents` (auto-generated by VS Code)

### Added

- One-click commit message generation via sparkle button in Source Control title bar

### Technical

- TypeScript strict mode with webpack bundling
